This code contains a javascript function to be run in the console. It draws circles to provide a general solution to the 'additional challenges' at the end of video 2-5 in the MIT xPRO Full Stack Web Development course.
Call the drawCircles function with the desired parameters: numberOuterCircles, innerCircleRadius and sumRadius.
The function creates a number of divs equal to the number of outer circles you wish to draw (plus an inner circle if you chose a non-zero inner circle radius).
It uses an angle step approach to draw additional divs spaced evenly around the center point of the inner circle to create the symmetrical shapes from that challenge.
As a bonus, it also runs a function that clears the existing circles each time it's drawn so you always start from a clean slate.
